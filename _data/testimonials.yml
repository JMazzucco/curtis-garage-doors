  testimonial: "I am very happy with the service I received from Curtis Schneider from Uptown Doors.  After showing me various door styles and colours, I settled on a carriage style door which was promptly installed. Curtis explained the new operating system thoroughly. My new garage door has completely transformed the front exterior of my home."
