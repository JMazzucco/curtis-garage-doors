  testimonial: "I am very happy with the service I received from Curtis Schneider from Uptown Doors.  After showing me various door styles and colours, I settled on a carriage style door which was promptly installed. Curtis explained the new operating system thoroughly. My new garage door has completely transformed the front exterior of my home."

  testimonial: "Curtis came to install a new garage door for me in Feb 2016. I found him to be very reasonable with his pricing, he explained everything to me step by step about what he was going to do and was very reliable coming within the time frame that he had promised. I was very pleased with the final job that he did. If you need a new garage door, call Uptown Doors."
